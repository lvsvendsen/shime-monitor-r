# shime-monitor-r
SHIME Monitor (`shime_monitor.R`) visualizes data from the Simulator of the Human Intestinal Microbial Ecosystem (SHIMEÂ®), a dynamic in vitro gut model system. The script processes and displays both pump activity and pH measurements, providing researchers with clear visualizations of system behavior during gut microbiome experiments.
