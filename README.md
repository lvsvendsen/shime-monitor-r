# shime-monitor-r

## Version
1.0.0

## Overview
SHIME Monitor (`shime_monitor.R`) visualizes data from the Simulator of the Human Intestinal Microbial Ecosystem (SHIME速), a dynamic in vitro gut model system. The script processes and displays both pump activity and pH measurements, providing researchers with clear visualizations of system behavior during gut microbiome experiments.

## Background
During SHIME速 experiments, microbial fermentation of non-digestible carbohydrates produces short-chain fatty acids such as acetate, butyrate, and propionate. This fermentation activity changes the pH in the reactors, which is automatically corrected by acid and base pumps to maintain target pH levels. By monitoring both pH readings and pump activity, researchers can:
- Track microbial fermentation activity
- Verify proper system operation
- Identify potential issues or interesting patterns

## Features
- Visualizes acid and base pump activity over time
- Displays pH measurements from probes
- Supports multiple treatment conditions
- Handles data from both PC (proximal colon) and DC (distal colon) reactors
- Allows flexible date range selection
- Configurable through YAML file

## Requirements
### Software
- R (latest version recommended)
- Required R packages:
	- yaml
	- dplyr
	- ggplot2
	- scales

### Input Files
It is recommended that the user directly extract Logs.csv files from the .accdbt SHIME速 file (using Microsoft Access or similar), WITH default headings.

1. PumpsLogs.csv file containing:
	- "ID"
	- "LogDate" (format: DD-MM-YYYY HH:MM:SS)
	- "PumpNr"
	- "Volume"

2. pHLogs.csv file containing:
	- "ID"
	- "LogDate" (format: DD-MM-YYYY HH:MM:SS)
	- "ProbeNr"
	- "Ph"

3. config.yaml file with user-specified settings
	- ALL fields must be inputted by user

## Setup
1. Place `shime_monitor.R` in your working directory
2. Create/modify `config.yaml` with your settings
3. Ensure your pump and pH log files are in the specified location
4. Run the script

## Output
The script generates plots showing:
- Acid pump activity over time for each reactor  
- Base pump activity over time for each reactor  
- pH measurements over time for each reactor  
- Data grouped by treatment conditions

## Troubleshooting
Common issues and solutions:
* **Missing data**: Verify date range in config matches your data files
* **File not found**: Check file paths and working directory
* **Parsing errors**: Ensure correct date format and separators
* **Empty plots**: Verify pump/probe numbers match your data
